# Risk Analysis

## Regulatory Risk

**Description:** Regulatory change or interpretation that classifies Ultima Forma unexpectedly (e.g., as financial institution, data controller with expanded obligations).

**Probability:** Medium. **Impact:** High.

**Mitigation:**
- Prior legal opinion on positioning
- Monitoring of regulation (LGPD*, BACEN*, future digital identity norms)
- Architecture design that minimizes points of attention (do not store credentials, do not decide on credit)
- Engagement with sandboxes and working groups when available

---

## Adoption Risk

**Description:** Market does not adopt sovereign identity or orchestration at expected pace; verifiers prefer traditional KYC*; issuers do not integrate.

**Probability:** Medium. **Impact:** High.

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on use cases with clear ROI* (cost reduction, compliance)
- Pilot with anchor partner for validation
- Messaging oriented to business value, not just technology
- Flexibility to adapt product to hybrid flows (credentials + traditional verification) if needed

---

## Big Tech Risk

**Description:** Large platforms launch competing offerings with superior scale and distribution.

**Probability:** Medium. **Impact:** Medium–High.

**Mitigation:**
- Positioning in regulated vertical where Big Tech faces more restrictions
- Emphasis on neutrality and interoperability (differentiator)
- Building issuer and verifier network before eventual entry
- Partnerships with governments and institutions that value provider diversification

---

## Technological Risk

**Description:** Security vulnerability, infrastructure failure, or obsolescence of adopted standards.

**Probability:** Low–Medium. **Impact:** Medium–High.

**Mitigation:**
- Use of mature standards (W3C* Verifiable Credentials, DID*)
- Security audits and secure development practices
- Infrastructure redundancy and monitoring
- Architecture that minimizes attack surface (do not store sensitive data)

---

## Execution Risk

**Description:** Failure to deliver product on time, close clients, or retain talent; undercapitalization.

**Probability:** Medium. **Impact:** High.

**Mitigation:**
- Realistic roadmap with incremental milestones
- Critical hiring (technical, commercial) with efficient use of capital
- Adequate runway in funding
- Tracking metrics and course adjustment
