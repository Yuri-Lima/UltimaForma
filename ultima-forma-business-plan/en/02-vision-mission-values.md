# Vision, Mission & Values

## Vision (10+ Year Horizon)

Ultima Forma envisions a scenario where digital identity is portable infrastructure controlled by the user: credentials issued once, reusable across multiple contexts, always with explicit consent. Companies and governments interoperate through open standards; identity fragmentation ceases to be a structural barrier. The centralized model of "ask for everything and store everything" is replaced by on-demand verification, minimizing data and maximizing privacy.

## Mission (3-Year Horizon)

Establish Ultima Forma as the reference in credential orchestration in the target market, with measurable execution:

- Conduct **1–2 million** verifications per year
- Operate with **20–30 paying clients**, including **3–5** annual/enterprise contracts in production
- Establish integrations with **3–5** reference credential issuers

The mission is guided by adoption metrics (verifications, clients) and quality (integration time, satisfaction).

## Core Values

### 1. Neutrality

The infrastructure does not favor issuers or verifiers. The design is agnostic; the choice remains with the ecosystem.

### 2. Consent First

No data is shared without explicit consent from the holder. Consent is granular, revocable, and auditable.

### 3. Interoperability

The architecture adopts open standards (W3C* Verifiable Credentials, DID*) to ensure credentials and flows work beyond a single vendor.

### 4. Privacy by Design

Data minimization, absence of centralized user data storage, and cryptographic guarantees are architecture requirements, not options.

### 5. Transparency

Data policies, technical flows, and regulatory positioning are documented and accessible. Lack of transparency is avoided in decisions affecting holders and clients.
