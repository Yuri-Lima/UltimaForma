# Market Thesis

## Why This Market Exists

Identity verification is a structural need in regulated sectors (financial, insurance, healthcare, government) and in digital transactions in general. The market exists because third parties need to trust identity attributes (who they are, where they live, what qualifications they have) for credit decisions, onboarding, service access, and regulatory compliance.

## Why It Is Growing

- **Digitization**: Transactions and relationships migrate to digital channels; remote verification replaces in-person.
- **Regulation**: eIDAS* 2.0 (Europe), LGPD* (Brazil), GDPR* and local frameworks raise consent and portability requirements.
- **Behavior**: Users increasingly demand more control and transparency over personal data.
- **Economics**: Cost reduction per verification and conversion improvement generate interest in new approaches.

## Regulatory Drivers

| Regulation | Impact |
|-------------|---------|
| **GDPR / LGPD** | Consent, data minimization, and right to be forgotten drive models based on portability and holder control |
| **eIDAS 2.0** | Digital identity wallets and qualified credentials create demand for interoperable orchestration |
| AML*/KYC* | Identity verification requirements sustain market; decentralized models need to prove compliance |

## Technological Drivers

- Open standards (W3C* Verifiable Credentials, DID*) enable interoperability between systems.
- Cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs enable verification without unnecessary data exposure.
- Cloud infrastructure and standardized APIs* reduce integration cost.

## Behavioral Shift

Consumers increasingly value privacy and portability. Acceptance of "share everything with each company" declines; the expectation of "having one credential and reusing it" increases. Companies perceive reputational and regulatory risk in models focused on data accumulation.

## TAM, SAM and SOM

To size the market, we use TAM*, SAM* and SOM*.

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)

Global identity verification and KYC market. Reference estimates: US$ 15–25 billion by 2030, CAGR* (Compound Annual Growth Rate) around 12–15%.

Methodology: triangulation of public market projections for "identity verification" and "KYC", noting that different reports use distinct taxonomies and scopes (software vs. services, verification vs. onboarding, biometric vs. non-biometric). We use the **US$ 15–25B** range as a conservative reference for digital verification and KYC scope in regulated sectors.

### SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)

Segment accessible with the current solution: mid and large companies in FinTech, healthcare, and public sector, in regions with favorable regulatory framework (EU*, Brazil, LATAM*) - around 15–25% of TAM, considering vertical and geography.

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)

Realistic share in the first 3–5 years: enterprise clients in initial geographies and verticals - around 0.5–2% of SAM over a 36-month horizon. Conservative assumptions. Refinement will be done with pilot data.
