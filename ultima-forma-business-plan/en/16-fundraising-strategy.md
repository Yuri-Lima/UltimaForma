# Fundraising Strategy

## Objectives per Round

### Pre-seed

**Target:** **BRL 3.5 million**

**Objective:** Deliver production MVP, close paid pilots, and structure the commercial base for recurrence (subscription and first annual contracts).

**Target runway*:** **16–18 months** (assuming average burn of ~**BRL 220k/month**, with hiring ramp)

### Seed

**Target:** **BRL 12 million**

**Objective:** Scale acquisition and retention, consolidate annual contracts, and prepare the company for Series A with efficiency metrics (LTV:CAC, payback) and revenue predictability.

**Target runway*:** **18–24 months** (average burn **BRL 480–550k/month**, with commercial and engineering expansion)

## Capital Allocation (Pre-seed)

| Category | Approx. % | Use |
|-----------|--------------|-----|
| **Product / Engineering** | **45%** | MVP in production, verification policies (basic/qualified), audit trails, observability, and security hardening |
| **Commercial** | **25%** | Prospecting and consultative sales (pilots), materials and playbooks, first BD*/AE* hires and technical pre-sales (partial) |
| **Operations / Legal** | **10%** | LGPD and data governance, contracts (MSA*/DPA*), initial SLAs, financial/accounting structure |
| **Reserve** | **20%** | Contingency, currency/infra variation, and runway extension if sales cycles lengthen |

**Reference values (on BRL 3.5M)**
- **Product / Engineering (45%)**: **BRL 1.58M**
- **Commercial (25%)**: **BRL 875k**
- **Operations / Legal (10%)**: **BRL 350k**
- **Reserve (20%)**: **BRL 700k**

---

## Runway* Assumptions

- **Estimated monthly burn rate (average): BRL 220k/month**
  - Typical ramp: **BRL 180k/month** (months 1–3) → **BRL 250k/month** (months 10–18)
  - Compatible with the fixed base of cloud/observability/security and partial operation described in the "Unit Economics" section, with growth per clients and SLAs
- **Hired in pre-seed (core team): 6 FTE** (with 1–2 optional positions by traction)
- **Revenue (conservative, but not "zero"):** first paying clients from **M6–M9**, with focus on **Starter/Growth subscription** and pilots at early adopter price
- **Gross margin:** high from the start (low variable COGS), but **burn** is dominated by team, reliability, and acquisition/sales (go-to-market) (per "Unit Economics" section)

---

## Expected Milestones (Pre-seed → Seed)

- **Product**: MVP in production with audit trails and **basic** and **qualified** verification stabilized; minimum operation automation (alerts, rate limiting, evidence per event).
- **Traction**: **3–6 paying clients** (mix of pilots + at least **1–2** subscriptions), with at least **1 replicable use case** (playbook).
- **Revenue**: start of recurrence, with target of **MRR* BRL 40–80k** at end of period (conservative), prioritizing base quality and retention.
- **Efficiency**: first signs of healthy LTV:CAC (mainly in Starter/Growth), with CAC still calibrating.

## Hiring Plan (Pre-seed)

| Priority | Profile | Objective |
|------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Backend / platform engineer | API* core, performance, audit trail, security reinforcement |
| 2 | Full-stack / integrations engineer | SDKs, developer experience (DX), integration templates, basic console |
| 3 | Product / Tech Lead | Architecture, prioritization, use-case-oriented delivery |
| 4 | Commercial (BD*/AE*) | Pilots, first subscription contracts, pipeline |
| 5 | Technical pre-sales (SE) — partial or consultant | Accelerate integrations and shorten sales cycle |
| 6 | Legal / Compliance — partial | Contracts, LGPD, regulated client requirements |

## Use of Resources (Seed, when applicable)

**Seed thesis:** Transform initial traction into **predictable recurring revenue** (subscriptions and annual contracts), maintaining acquisition efficiency (payback) and raising competitive barriers via reliability, auditable evidence, and integrations.

**Indicative allocation (Seed)**

| Area | % | Example uses |
|---|---:|---|
| **Product / Engineering** | **48%** | Scalability, high availability, SLAs, operational automation (SRE), integrations, and qualified package expansion (evidence/policies) |
| **Commercial** | **33%** | Dedicated team (AE + SE), playbooks by vertical, Growth expansion, and Enterprise/SLA start |
| **Marketing / Demand generation** | **12%** | Selective ABM, technical/compliance content, partnerships, industry events |
| **Operations / Legal / Compliance** | **7%** | Security, enterprise contracts, audits, governance |

**Reference values (on BRL 12M)**
- **Product / Engineering (48%)**: **BRL 5.76M**
- **Commercial (33%)**: **BRL 3.96M**
- **Marketing / Demand generation (12%)**: **BRL 1.44M**
- **Operations / Legal / Compliance (7%)**: **BRL 840k**

**Result targets at end of Seed (reference)**
- **ARR**: **BRL 4–6 million**
- **Revenue mix:** progression to recurring predominance (subscription + annual/SLA), aligned with "Business Model" section.
- **Portfolio:** **20–30 paying clients**, with **3–5 enterprise/annual** and Growth base as main ARR driver
- **Efficiency:** LTV:CAC **≥ 3:1** and payback **≤ 12 months** (anchors in "Unit Economics" section)

---

## Target Investors

- Early-stage funds focused on FinTech, identity, or infrastructure
- Angels with experience in regulated or digital identity
- Family offices with appetite for technology and long-term B2B thesis
- Corporate venture and strategics (when it makes sense) in KYC/compliance-intensive sectors

---

## Plan Base Consistency Notes

- The values above were calibrated to be **compatible** with the pricing structure in the "Business Model" section and the costs and margins in the "Unit Economics" section.
- The plan assumes that variable cost per verification remains low (high gross margin), and that the main runway determinant is **team + reliability + go-to-market**.
