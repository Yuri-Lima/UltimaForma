# What We Are and What We Are Not

This section aims to reduce regulatory ambiguity and align expectations of partners and investors.

## We Are

### Neutral Infrastructure

We do not favor issuers or verifiers. We pragmatically and impartially assess each party's capability to ensure data authenticity. The architecture is agnostic, and provider choice rests with the ecosystem. This guarantees interoperability and reduces conflicts of interest.

### Consent Layer

Data sharing only occurs with explicit, granular, and revocable consent from the holder. The user retains total control: what to share, when, and with whom.

### Interoperability Engine

We connect systems that currently operate in silos. Open standards allow credentials issued in one context to be verified in another, without dependence on a single vendor.

## We Are Not

### Bank

We do not take deposits, grant credit, or offer financial products. We operate only in the identity and credentials verification layer. We are not subject to banking regulation.

### Credit Provider

We do not assess credit risk or make lending decisions. We provide attested data; the credit decision is the verifier's.

### Centralized Data Repository

We do not store credentials or user identity data in our own repositories. Sovereign storage remains with the holder (wallet). We drastically reduce regulatory exposure and liability for data breaches.

### Identity Authority

We do not issue identities or official identity credentials. We connect issuers (governments, institutions) with holders and verifiers. We are not the primary source of truth about identity.

## Rationale by Boundary

| Boundary | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| **Not a bank** | Avoids banking licensing and complex regulation; keeps scope in data infrastructure |
| **Not a credit provider** | Avoids credit and scoring regulation; focus on verification, not decision |
| **Not a data repository** | Minimizes LGPD*/GDPR* obligations as controller; reduces breach risk and compliance costs |
| **Not an identity authority** | Avoids conflict with governments and regulators; positions as facilitator, not competitor |
