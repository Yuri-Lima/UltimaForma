## Initial Geography

**Brazil and selected LATAM**

Latin America has expanded and updated its data protection frameworks, with laws and authorities at different maturity and scope levels. Therefore, we treat "selected LATAM" as expansion to markets with **relevant privacy regulation** and growing regulated/digital ecosystem, evaluating country by country in the entry process (not as a fixed list).

Market with LGPD in force, expanding FinTech ecosystem, and first-mover opportunity in credential orchestration. Expansion to EU* (eIDAS*) in later phase, depending on resources and partnerships.
