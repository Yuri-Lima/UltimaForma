# Executive Summary

## Overview

Ultima Forma is a neutral identity and credentials orchestration infrastructure that connects issuers, verifiers, and end users without centralizing data. The company provides a consent and interoperability layer that reduces KYC* costs, eliminates redundancy, and returns data control to holders, establishing the credential issuer as the single source of truth (SSOT). Companies use the API* to perform credential verifications, while users keep their credentials in sovereign wallets and decide what to share.

## Market Opportunity

The identity verification and KYC market is fragmented, with high operational costs (references point to **BRL 40–100** per verification in traditional flows for individuals and around **BRL 10–12,500** per corporate review), data inconsistency between systems, and exposure to fraud. Regulatory (eIDAS* 2.0, GDPR*, LGPD*) and technological drivers (W3C* Verifiable Credentials, DID*) create a window of opportunity for consent-based neutral infrastructure.

## Why Now

European eIDAS 2.0 regulation sets standards for digital identity wallets; GDPR and LGPD reinforce consent and data minimization requirements. The adoption of verifiable credentials and sovereign identity shifts from concept to market requirement. The timing is favorable for neutral infrastructure before proprietary solutions dominate the ecosystem.

## Product Vision

The solution includes: (1) Identity Wallet for end users, with sovereign storage and granular sharing control; (2) Orchestration Platform connecting issuers, verifiers, and wallets; (3) Enterprise API for integration with legacy systems and KYC/AML* flows.

## Business Model

Revenue per verification, subscription plans for medium volumes, and enterprise SLA* for large customers. Initial priority on recurring revenue via subscriptions, with variable usage component.

## Company Stage

Current stage: pre-operational / pre-seed. Seeking funding for technical validation, first pilot, and commercial structure.

## Funding Request

**BRL 3.5 million (pre-seed round).** The capital enables a **16–18 month** execution cycle to deliver **MVP in production**, close **paid pilots**, and structure the commercial base for **recurring revenue** (subscriptions and first annual contracts), maintaining high reliability and audit trails.

**Strategic positioning in one sentence:** Ultima Forma is the neutral infrastructure that orchestrates identity credentials with holder consent, enabling companies to reduce KYC costs and users to maintain sovereignty over their data, providing a neutral layer of portable and interoperable **identity**.
