# Competitive Landscape

## Direct Competitors

Companies offering credential orchestration, identity wallets, or verification infrastructure based on sovereign identity standards.

**Common characteristics:**
- Focus on Verifiable Credentials or equivalents
- B2B2C* or B2B* model
- Operation in one or few geographies

**Ultima Forma differentiation:** Explicit positioning as **neutral infrastructure** (does not compete with issuers or verifiers) with emphasis on **not centralizing data**. Initial focus on Brazil/LATAM*, designed from the start for LGPD* and GDPR* and integration with local/regulated ecosystem. In addition:

- **Rare know-how in identity and resolution at scale**: The conception comes from experts with broad experience in **digital identification** and **identity resolution** using **Big Data**, applied in governmental and high-criticality environments (e.g., Federal Police, ABIN*, Central Bank of Brazil, Attorney General). This translates into technical pragmatism (governance, data quality, deduplication, matching, audit) and sensitivity to security and privacy constraints.
- **AI-first**: The platform has as co-founder a market-reference expert in building AI-first systems focused on reliability, cost, and security.
  - **Product**: AI as pillar from conception, with ability to incorporate automation and intelligent assistance into journeys (e.g., flow generation and validation, inconsistency detection), without compromising compliance requirements in regulated environments.
  - **Engineering**: combination of software engineering with evaluation (evals), observability, prompt/model governance, and quality automation to accelerate delivery cycles with reliability.
  - **Operation**: intelligent monitoring, incident classification and routing, risk and compliance analysis. In customer service and support, AI enables faster diagnostics, assisted self-service, and living knowledge base, reducing response time, operational cost, and headcount.
- **Regulatory depth and governance**: deep knowledge of **corporate governance**, main global regulations related to identity, data, and privacy, and the workings of the **governmental environment**. This combination reduces execution risk, shortens sales/implementation cycles in regulated sectors, and increases institutional credibility.

## Indirect Competitors

### Traditional KYC Providers

Companies offering document, selfie, and database verification. Model centered on collecting, storing, and comparing data.

**Overlap:** They solve the same problem (identity verification) with a different approach.

**Difference:** Ultima Forma orchestrates existing credentials, rather than collecting and storing documents. This reduces friction for the end user (less repeated document submission and form filling) and decreases exposure of sensitive data. The model is complementary or substitute depending on the use case.

### Authentication Providers

Single sign-on (SSO*), MFA* and access management companies.

**Overlap:** Both involve digital identity.

**Difference:** Authentication answers "who is accessing." Credential verification answers "what attributes does the holder have." Different use cases, plus integration possibility.

## Big Tech as Substitutes

Platforms like Apple, Google, and Meta have scale and identity data (federated authentication).

**Risks:** They may expand to attribute verification and have distribution power.

**Countermove:** Big Tech dependence generates regulatory and privacy resistance. The neutral and interoperable model meets sovereignty and diversification requirements. Positioning in regulated (FinTech, healthcare) reduces attractiveness for Big Tech in the short term.

## Government Identity Systems

Gov.br (Brazil), eID (Europe), other national programs.

**Relationship:** Potential **partners and issuers**, not competitors. Ultima Forma orchestrates credentials and governments issue. Integration with Gov.br and equivalents is strategic.

---

## Strategic Gap

The gap Ultima Forma occupies:

- **Neutral**: Does not compete with issuers or verifiers
- **Decentralized**: Does not centralize data and thus reduces risk and responsibility
- **Interoperable**: Open standards avoid lock-in
- **Focused on regulated**: FinTech and initial vertical with strong KYC* and compliance demand
- **Indirect benefit to end user**: Delivers convenience in document presentation and form filling, with the central point of **control and privacy** over their information (minimum necessary sharing, with traceability and less data replication).

Direct competitors are few in Brazil/LATAM; timing and positioning allow capturing demand before saturation.
