# Moat and Defensibility

## Network Effects

- **More issuers** → More credentials available → More value for verifiers
- **More verifiers** → More use cases → More incentive for issuers to join
- **More end users (wallet)** → More convenience and trust (control/privacy) → Higher conversion rate and acceptance by verifiers → More demand for issuer credentials

The platform works as a hub. Each new participant increases value for the others. The effect strengthens with the installed base.

## Integration Depth

- Integration with legacy systems (ERP*, CRM*, onboarding flows) generates implementation and training cost.
- Custom APIs*, webhooks, and client-specific flows increase switching cost.
- The deeper the integration, the lower the probability of churn for a marginally cheaper solution.

---

## Switching Cost

For the verifier, switching orchestrators implies:

- Technical reintegration
- New consent flows for users
- Possible change in supported issuers
- Internal retraining

Switching cost is relevant when the solution is in production and integrated.

---

## Trust Infrastructure

- Relationship with qualified issuers (governments, institutions) requires time and credibility.
- Certifications, audits, and operational track record built over time.
- Trust is not replicated quickly; it is a cumulative asset.

---

## Brand Positioning

- Being recognized as **neutral** and **trustworthy** infrastructure differentiates from alternatives that centralize data or have conflicts of interest.
- Brand associated with privacy and interoperability attracts regulated entities and privacy-conscious holders.
- Being perceived as the **legitimate substitute for the physical document**, through the wallet: same function (prove attributes), with superior experience. **Convenience** (faster presentation and filling, less repetition) and **privacy/control** (minimum necessary sharing and less data exposure).

---

## What Is Not a Moat

- **Isolated technology**: Technical implementation can be replicated. Value is in the network and integration.
- **First-mover without execution**: Initial advantage only holds with execution and adoption.
- **Regulation as barrier**: Regulation can favor or restrict. Therefore, it is not a moat by itself without compliance execution.
